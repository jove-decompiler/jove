# JOVE README
`jove` is a dynamic decompiler for C programs built on top of QEMU and the LLVM compiler infrastructure. By observing the targets of indirect jumps at runtime, it accurately disassembles native code. Currently, the C code it produces is generated by `llvm-cbe`, it is linux-only, and it supports several different architectures: `i386`, `x86_64`, `mips`, `mipsel`, `mips64el`, and `aarch64`.

The conventional [view](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/236#issuecomment-475071173) often held is that it is not possible to automatically perform a decompilation that can, in fact, be recompiled. `jove` demonstrates this to be false.
