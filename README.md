# JOVE README
`jove` is a dynamic decompiler for C programs built on top of QEMU and the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) compiler infrastructure. By observing control-flow at runtime, it is capable of perfectly disassembling machine-code binaries. The output is such that it can be modified, recompiled, and, run. Currently, the C code it produces is generated by `llvm-cbe`. It targets linux on `i386`, `x86_64`, `mips`, `mipsel`, `mips64el`, and `aarch64`, and Windows x86/x64 executables under WINE.

## USAGE
For a quickstart, use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aleden22/jove/general) and see [Examples.md](/Documentation/Examples.md).
