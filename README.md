# JOVE README
`jove` is a dynamic decompiler for C programs built on top of QEMU and the LLVM compiler infrastructure. By observing the targets of indirect jumps at runtime, it accurately disassembles native code. Currently, the C code it produces is generated by `llvm-cbe`, it is linux-only, and it supports several different architectures: `i386`, `x86_64`, `mips`, `mipsel`, `mips64el`, and `aarch64`.

## USAGE
For a quickstart, use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aleden22/jove/general) and see [Examples.md](/Documentation/Examples.md).
