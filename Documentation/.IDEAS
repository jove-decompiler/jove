make the stack pointer llvm::Type be a pointer to a word (i.e. i64* or i32* (depending on the word size))
 - expressions of the form
  load i64, (inttoptr (sub 8 %sp) to i64*)
   will be instead
  load i64, (i64* getelementptr %stack 0, -1)
   where
  %stack = alloca [STACK_FRAME_BYTES x i8]
   similarly, expressions of the form
  load i64, (inttoptr (add 8 %sp) to i64*)
   will be instead an i'th function parameter, depending on the constant offset
use hardware watchpoints to prove that a pair of MCInst's constitute a callee register save, by first
  identifying candidate callee register saves & restores
  using SW breakpoints, allow the tracer to have the opportunity to mess with the tracee (e.g. modifying HW watchpoints) in the window of the lifetime of the function.
  the function, assuming it returns, will provide a window in which it is necessary that two instructions, and only the pair which push and restore the register, are the ones that modify the memory at that position in the stack.
  Q: why do we have to create this "window" in the first place? why not have it always exist, until the function has returned
     because after the function returns anything could be put there (stack contents have changed)
